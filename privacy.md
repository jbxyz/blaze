## Data Collected
- The data is stored as long as the bot is in the server. When blaze gets kicked from a server, that server's data in our database anad cache will be deleted.
- We do not collect any personal information relating a discord user's account like passwords or any other credentials. Blaze never requests for any personal data of a user.
- The data we collect includes the User IDs, Server IDs, Server Owner IDs, Channel IDs and Some Role IDs.
- The bot may record command error messages, join and leave guild messages to a logging channel in the blaze's support server for the developer's knowledge.

## Why we collect Data
- The data is required to make sure the bot functions properly.
- Without this data, our bot will not be able to perform commands like change prefix, server info and user info commands, and the economy module, thus making the features inaccessible for users, decreasing their overall satisfaction.

## Data Deletion
- A user may request for their data to be deleted in our support server on discord through our ticket system. 
- A user could direct message one of the founders on discord.
- If the user has admission permissions in the server, they can kick blaze from the server.
